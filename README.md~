# historyMining
Repository to mine the web for important historical events. I wish to extract as much records of historical events by mining the web. I don't really know what I wish to gain from this; maybe it's just the experience of mining a really huge corpus of data that is available in almost every conceivable digital form, or maybe it might just bring out some really crazy facts that we never knew about our world or we knew them but were too afraid to speak out. So if you're interested in taking part in something like this please let me know, I'd love to hear your views on it and I'm sure we can come to some really good conclusions.
